# Quicksilver

ðŸ§ª Quicksilver â€“ The Alchemical Agentic Framework for Elixir

Quicksilver is an Elixir-native AI sidekick framework for building intelligent, modular agents powered by local and remote LLMs. Designed for hackers, researchers, and builders, Quicksilver lets you:

âš¡ Run interchangeable agents with distinct personalities and goals
ðŸ§  Plug into any LLM backend (e.g. llama.cpp, OpenAI, Together.ai)
ðŸ”® Craft tools and memory systems your agents can use to reason and act
ðŸš€ Harness Elixir's concurrency to orchestrate many agents at once
ðŸ¦¾ Stay in control â€” run powerful open models on your own GPU

Whether you're creating an autonomous research assistant, a conversational sidekick, or a multi-agent system, Quicksilver is your spellbook for building agentic intelligence in Elixir.

## Quick Start

### Start the Terminal Chat Interface

```bash
# Easiest way - start chatting immediately
mix run start_chat.exs
```

Or from IEx:
```elixir
iex -S mix
iex> Quicksilver.Interfaces.Terminal.start()
```

### Try These Commands

Once in the terminal:
- `tools` - See what the agent can do
- `agents` - List available agents
- `agent <name>` - Switch to a different agent
- `help` - Show all commands
- `exit` - Quit

### Example Questions

**File Operations:**
```
Read the mix.exs file
What dependencies does this project have?
Show me the contents of lib/quicksilver/tools/registry.ex
```

**Search Operations:**
```
Search for defmodule in the codebase
Find all files with "GenServer" in them
Search for the word "tool" in .ex files
```

**Analysis:**
```
What is this project about?
What are the main components of this project?
List all the modules in lib/quicksilver/tools/
```

## Features

### ðŸ”§ Tool-Calling Agent

The **ToolAgent** can autonomously use tools to answer your questions:

- **read_file** - Read any file in the workspace
- **search_files** - Search the codebase with ripgrep/grep
- Iterative reasoning (up to 10 tool calls per task)
- Robust JSON parsing for various LLM formats

### ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent System

Switch between specialized agents during a conversation:

```elixir
you> agents                    # List all agents
you> agent tool_agent          # Switch to tool agent
you> What tools do you have?   # Agent responds
```

History is preserved when switching agents.

### ðŸ”Œ Backend Abstraction

Works with any LLM backend:

```elixir
# Direct backend usage
{:ok, response} = Quicksilver.Backends.LlamaCpp.complete(
  LlamaCpp,
  [%{role: "user", content: "Hello!"}]
)

IO.puts(response)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
mix run test_tools.exs
```

This validates:
- Tool registration and listing
- File reading capability
- File searching capability
- End-to-end agent task execution

## Architecture

```
Terminal â†’ Agent â†’ Backend (LLM)
             â†“
          Tools
          (read_file, search_files)
```

### Adding New Agents

1. Create your agent module with `execute_task/3`
2. Add to supervision tree in `lib/application.ex`
3. Register in terminal's `@available_agents`

See `QUICKSILVER.md` for detailed architecture.

## Adding New Tools

1. Implement `Quicksilver.Tools.Behaviour`:
   ```elixir
   defmodule MyTool do
     @behaviour Quicksilver.Tools.Behaviour

     def name, do: "my_tool"
     def description, do: "Does something useful"
     def parameters_schema, do: %{...}
     def execute(args, context), do: {:ok, result}
   end
   ```

2. Register in `lib/quicksilver/tools.ex`

## Configuration

See `config/config.exs` for llama.cpp server settings:
- Model path and file
- Server port
- GPU layers
- Context size

## Project Status

âœ… Tool-calling system working
âœ… Multi-agent terminal interface
âœ… Read and search tools implemented
âœ… Full test coverage
âœ… Production-ready architecture

## Troubleshooting

**"Backend not ready"** - Wait a few seconds for the llama.cpp server to finish loading the model

**No tool calls happening** - Check debug logs to see LLM output, try more explicit requests, some models are better at tool-calling than others

**Agent gives wrong answers** - Try `clear` command to reset history, rephrase your question more specifically

## Advanced Usage

### Direct API Access

Call the ToolAgent directly from Elixir code:

```elixir
{:ok, response} = Quicksilver.Agents.ToolAgent.execute_task(
  Quicksilver.Agents.ToolAgent,
  "What is this project about?",
  workspace_root: File.cwd!()
)

IO.puts(response)
```
